# Motion Compensated Pulse Rate Estimation
Project completed as part of AI for Healthcare Nanodegree (Udacity).
## Overview
This repository contains two parts of a final project submission as part of the AI for Healthcare Nanodegree offered by Udacity. The first part of the project involves building a pulse rate algorithm, while the second part involves a clinical application of the algorithm.
#### Contents
The repository includes a Jupyter notebook `pulse_rate.ipynb` that contains the code for the pulse rate algorithm.
In the code section, the pulse rate algorithm is implemented and tested using the Troika dataset. The goal of this algorithm is to estimate the heart rate from a wrist-type photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal during intensive physical exercise.
